# encoder-rtx

Pre-training an encoder to be a decision model: a model that takes a `state` and typed
questions about it, and returns a probability for every allowed answer (the shape of
TypeSafe's System One API). The starting idea is to train jointly on MLM and on
predictions distilled from an open decision model, beginning from
[`decoder-rtx`](../decoder-rtx/)'s code.

**Status:** idea stage (October 2026); nothing is implemented. The kickoff context and the
discussion are in `agent-ops-stacks/encoder-rtx/` (private).
